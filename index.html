                    <p>
                        When designing games and mechanics I like to have the player learn
                        subconsciously rather than being told through text what to do. The
                        ability for games to teach complex systems to players in an
                        intuitive way is something that interests me. For example, when it
                        came to designing these elements in Cyber Sphere, symbols and
                        colours were used rather than text to explain what the players
                        were meant to do.

							This is a game I that I worked as a designer on. Our Client - a

							game where the players would play using trackballs. This worked
							out well and the university even pushed the game at their showcase

							Scotland’s biggest gaming event, Resonate.
